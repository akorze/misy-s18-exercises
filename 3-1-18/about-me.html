  <!-- A section that describes the brown bear -->
  <p>Hey, my name is Michael, and there's little I find more exciting than bears! I've spent most of my young life
    traveling to the edges of Earth to take videos of these wonderful creatures. <br /> <br /> Family, Country, Bears, <br /> <br /> Michael D.
